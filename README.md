# Bioinformatics-Gene-Analysis
**Goal**: Identify gene sequences (hsp70, mcrA) in proteomes with potential pH resistance.

### Tools & Technologies
- Bash, HMMER, MUSCLE, UNIX parsing tools

### Key Steps
- Built automated pipeline to align sequences and scan 50+ proteomes
- Parsed HMM output for candidates meeting significance thresholds

### Output
- Summary files with high-confidence candidates
- Shell script and modular components for reproducibility

### Files(have to check for correctness)
- `pipeline.sh`: main automation script
- `results_summary.txt`: filtered gene candidates
